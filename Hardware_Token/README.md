This folder contains the code and design for the hardware token used in the ECE 
180DA senior capstone project. 

# Project Materials:
* 1 x Raspberry Pi Zero W
* 3 x Common Cathode 7_seg displays
* 2 x 1uF capacitors
* 2 x Push Buttons
* 1 x LED
* 1 x Toggle Switch
* 5 x 1k Ohm Resistors
* 3 x 10k Ohm Resistors
* 1 x ProtoBoard (Breadboard works too, but components should ideally be soldered)

# Wiring:
